# Study of Adult Income Data Set
This is a study of this data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
    
This tries several methods to get the best F1 score. Focuses on various feature selection methods

# Simple machine learning algorithms
Manual implementations of simple ML algorithms (without sklearn) (just for fun)

1) K nearest neighbors with data set from Coursera ML course (week3)

2) Naive Bayes
