### 2017-09 Predicting Customer Calls from Network Anomalies
- Network elements emit health measurements (CPU temperature, signal quality, number of connected devices...). When measurement's [Z-Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) is above some threshold compared to expected value ==> anomaly
- This notebook shows how a neural network can learn to predict from historical data increases of customer calls when network anomalies are detected
